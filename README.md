# Cards Against Deqmandity

This is a little script I hacked together to generate card images for our
[Cards Against Humanity](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/) clone, **"Cards
Against Deqmandity"**. Cards Against Decmandity was a project we made as an
early wedding gift to our good friends Declan and Amanda.

See [my blog post about
it](http://www.devjustinian.com/2014/06/cards-against-deqmandity.html) for more
info.

To generate your own images, fill whites.csv and blacks.csv with your white
and black card descriptions, and run ``drawcards.py``.

## Requirements

Python (I used 2.7), and the Python Imaging Library.
